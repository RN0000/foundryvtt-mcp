Multiplication and Foundry modifier syntax such as "4d6kh3" or "1d20r1" are rejected on both transports, with an error naming the offending character and its position, never dropped from the total in silence. Parentheses are the one difference: with FOUNDRY_API_KEY set the formula goes to FoundryVTT\'s own Roll engine, which evaluates them, while the default Socket.IO transport rolls locally and rejects them by name - and a REST roll that cannot reach the server falls back to that same local roller, so a parenthesised formula can still fail there. Prefer the expanded form when it matters. Use when: the user asks for a check, save, attack, damage, or any random result.';
